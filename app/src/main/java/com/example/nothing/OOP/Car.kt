//we define the inheritance of a class by using the " : " sign after the child class name linking to the parent class
// but a class in kotlin is 'final' by default (meaning it doesn't permit inheritance).
// so we need to modify the visibility modifier of the parent class 'Vehicle' by adding the 'open' keyword


// creation of the 'Car' child class
class Car : Vehicle() {
